# # COVID-19 identification in primary care records from Feb-July 2020: classification of codes for OpenSAFELY studies
#
# ## Background
#
# Primary care records offer an opportunity to ascertain cases of COVID-19 which do not necessarily result in hospital admission or death. This could be useful for studying the burden of COVID-19 in the community, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection separately to risk of severe COVID-19, risk factors for mortality and case fatality ratios among those infected, and post-viral effects in people who had COVID-19 that did not require hospitalisation. 
#
# There are over 100 primary care (CTV3) codes with terms related to COVID-19 used by TPP and available for selection in studies performed in the OpenSAFELY platform (https://opensafely.org/).  The majority of these codes have been newly created for use in the current pandemic. The aim of this work was to assign these codes into categories related to the identification of COVID-19 in primary care, and to provide advice for studies using the OpenSAFELY platform that require people to be classified by their COVID-19 case status as defined in primary care records (either as an exposure or as an outcome).
#
# ## Methods
#
# An initial list of TPP primary care codes related to COVID-19 was obtained by searching the TPP database for terms containing "COV-2", "Coronavirus", or "COVID". The returned terms were cross-checked against the NHS Digital [COVID-19 SNOMED CT codes](https://hscic.kahootz.com/connect.ti/COVID19_info_sharing/view?objectId=67227941) and CTV3 codes for any missing terms which were added to the list when found.  The resulting list of terms was then reviewed by a team of clinicians, epidemiologists and statisticians in order to identify distinct categories of terms and assign terms into one of these distinct categories. 
#
# An initial analysis of (probable case and suspected case) sub-categories was then performed by plotting the following using OpenSAFELY data from between Feb â€“ July 2020 (1) the frequency of codes entered into TPP software by GPs over time and (2) the proportion of people dying due to (a) COVID-19 and (b) causes other than COVID-19 (using ONS cause of death data) in the 80 days after a record of a (probable case or suspected case) primary care code in TPP.
#
# -


#
# ## Results
#
# A total of 174 terms were identified. These were assigned into the 13 categories/subcategories detailed in the table below. The 13 codelists for classifying COVID-19 are publicly available on OpenSAFELY.org for inspection and re-use [codelists.opensafely.org](https://codelists.opensafely.org/).

"Probable" and "suspected" sub-categories are explored further here. 
Plots of frequency of codes (Figure 1) showed that while the frequency of use of "probable case: clinical code" (n={codecounts_total["probable_covid"]}) was similar to "probable case: positive test" (n={codecounts_total["probable_covid_pos_test"]}) over time, 
"probable case: sequelae" codes were used much less frequently over the whole time period (n={codecounts_total["probable_covid_sequelae"]}). 
Suspected case sub-categories were used much more frequently than "probable case: positive test" - suspected case: "advice given" (n={codecounts_total["suspected_covid_advice"]}),
"isolation code" (n={codecounts_total["suspected_covid_isolation"]}) and "suspected codes" (n={codecounts_total["suspected_covid"]}) (Figure 1). 
Plots of causes of death after each code showed marked differences in the proportion of death due to COVID-19 compared to deaths due to other causes for all probable case sub-categories; 
in contrast, COVID-19 deaths were not substantially higher than non-COVID deaths following codes in the "suspected" COVID-19 case sub-categories (Figure 2).
"""))


# ## Conclusion
#
# A high level of COVID-19 related mortality in people identified as "probable cases" is consistent with these codes identifying true COVID-19 cases with high specificity. "Suspected case" codes were more widely used but a much lower level of subsequent COVID-19 related mortality suggesting that these codes may have low specificity for COVID-19 and should be used with care.  Further work will include assessing the impact of the introduction of pillar 2 test results on utilisation of these codes, investigating code sensitivity, and understanding how individual patient characteristics relate to the varying probability of being tested.

## Technical details

This notebook was run on {today.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}, based on SystmOne data as at {S1_build_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}. 

Codelist activity is reported from {start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} to {end_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}. If a clinical code appears in the primary care record on multiple dates, the earliest date is used. 

This dataset was created using the study definition `/analysis/study_definintion.py`. 

If there are multiple events per patient within the extraction period, the earliest event date is extracted.

Only patients registered at their practice continuously for one year up to 1 Feb 2020 are included.

# ### Notes on OpenSAFELY
#
# OpenSAFELY is a data analytics platform built by a mixed team of software developers, clinicians, and epidemiologists from the Oxford DataLab, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Electronic Health Record research group, health software company TPP and NHS England. It represents a fundamentally different way of conducting electronic health record (EHR) research: instead of sending EHR data to a third party for analysis, we've developed a system for conducting analyses within the secure environment where the data is already stored, so that the electronic health record data never leaves the NHS ecosystem. 
#
# Currently, OpenSAFELY uses the electronic health records of all patients registered at a GP practice using the SystmOne clinical information system run by TPP, covering around 22 million people. Additional data for these patients covering COVID-related tests, hospital admissions, ITU admissions, and registered deaths are also securely imported to the platform.
